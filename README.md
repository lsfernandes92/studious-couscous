# studious-couscous

This repo consist in a simple toy app of users and their associated microposts (thus constituting a minimalist Twitter-style app).

The purpose is to get high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically.

Again, this is the continuation of the Michael Hartl Ruby on Rails tutorial that can be found in [here](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition-tutorial/toy_app), but also an attempt for me to get more practice with Rails.
